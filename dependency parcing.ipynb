We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life , most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000 . I 've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it `` needs '' charging , so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges , So I 'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge , and that 's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it 's new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke .\n",

Recently I retired and did n't need all the mins I got on the $ 39 plan -LRB- with taxes came to $ 44 -RRB- pro : I bought the razr v3 on ebay and transfered over to T-Mobile prepaid.the phone works just great and through my Parrot 3200ls handsfree sounds just great.con : When I went to program speed dialing . Boy was I disappointed . First it would only allow 20 voice tags . Then I had to record each individual tag for voice recognition My e815 allowed me to use unlimited voicetags and I did n't have to record my voice on each number , anyones voice would work using any name in my phone book . The Razr is supposed to be an improvement , which it 's not . The Motorola e815 was the best phone I ever owned , and now Motorola screwed it up . Whats the point of using bluetooth handsfree dialing when you have to scroll down to a name to dial , taking your hands off the wheel . Wake up Motorola , Thats stupid .\n",

We sent a couple text messages to each other that worked no problem.She used the phone as her Alarm clock the next morning which worked perfectly.Now as for what 1-2 reviewers have said about the battery life , most likely they have gotten one of those 1-2 out of 1000 . I 've had phone 12 days have charged it 3 times and have never let it go to the point where is says it `` needs '' charging , so average 4 days per charge and just like the manual states it appears as though battery life is getting a bit better after a few charges , So I 'm easily going to get 3-5 days per charge , and that 's with a lot of fiddling around with it because it 's new and 1-2 hours talk time.Some one mentioned they dropped the phone on its hinge and it broke .\n",

      "Parsing [sent. 1 len. 356]: I just bought the Motorola KRZRZ K1 phone from China , I was a bit leary , but this phone is hard to get at a reasonable price.The phone arrived and right away the 7 key would stick and when I hit it again I would get two 7 's . This cleared up and the 6 started to do the same thing . Then all of a sudden everything was fine.I gravitated from the Motorola v3 which I was n't crazy about , could never see the keys in daylight . The Krzrz K1 is such an improvement , much better voice , beautiful blue color , very easy to navigate , but best of all the battery lasts a full 5 days on standby . It has always bothered me that phone manufacturers promise 10-12 days and you only get 2 days when theyre new . Nokia is the worst offender.The bad on this phone is the voice recognition , you do n't train it , you just speak the name , but I have yet to see this phone get it right.Enunciating doesnt help and turning the sensitivity up or down does n't either . The phone will give you 3 choices to agree with the recognition and usually all three are wrong , so I have to scroll down to the name I want to call it 's quicker.However since I mostly need tags in the car when I 'm driving I have trained the car voice recognition to work , and thats what I mostly use.Lastly I paid $ 45 for this phone and I couldnt be happier.It 's unlocked , I use T-Mobile and I can use it in Europe.For me a cell phone is not a toy , so I do n't play games , text message or go onto the internet otherwise I would have bought a smart phone , and although this phone has a camera , I probably will never use it except in an emergency , and music , I use my ipod . For an outstanding phone this one ca n't be beat .\n",
